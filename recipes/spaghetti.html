    <h3><em>Spaghetti alla Carbonara</em></h3>
    
    <p>Carbonara, a Roman dish made with eggs, hard cheese, and cured pork. Its rich and silky sauce comes from beaten eggs tossed with hot pasta. The trick to making delicious carbonara is to make sure the pasta is hot enough to cook the eggs, but not so hot that they curdle. </p>
