The Odin Project - HTML Project

This is a site that contains 3 recipes, with their ingrediants and the cooking instructions.
P.S. My Fav is the Butter Chicken, though Thai curry is a close second!

Skills demonstrated:
 -linking of different HTML pages, using relative file paths
 -Organisation of proj. files into directories to improve code readability
 -Creating well structured HTML documents

Future Improvements to add:
-Adding CSS and JS to, style the site better and improve site-functionality
-Adding more recipes!!
