# odin-recipes
The Odin Project - HTML Project

This is a site that contains 3 recipes, with their ingredients and the cooking instructions.  
P.S. My favorite is the Butter Chicken, though Thai curry is a close second!

## Skills demonstrated:

- Linking of different HTML pages using relative file paths  
- Organization of project files into directories to improve code readability  
- Creating well-structured HTML documents  

## Future Improvements to add:

- Adding CSS and JS to style the site better and improve site functionality  
- Adding more recipes!!
